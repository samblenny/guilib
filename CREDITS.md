## Bitmap Typeface Glyphs

This project incorporates glyphs from the Chicago and Geneva bitmap typefaces
which were designed by Susan Kare and released by Apple in 1984. Chicago and
Geneva are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.

To the best of my knowledge, in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, bitmap
typeface glyphs (shapes of letters) are generally not subject to copyright or
design patent protection as long as the typeface is at least 25 years old.

Please note the significant distinction between making a derived work from a
font file (particularly vector fonts) compared to using glyphs from a typeface.
This project uses glyphs from bitmaps.


## Twemoji Emoji Graphics

This project includes modified versions of graphics from the twemoji project.

PNG with dithered grayscale shading.
